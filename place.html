            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The Philippines is an archipelago in Southeast Asia consisting of over 7,000 islands. It was first
                settled by Austronesian-speaking peoples around 3000 BCE. Spanish explorer Ferdinand Magellan arrived in
                1521, leading to over three centuries of Spanish colonization. The Philippines declared independence
                from Spain on June 12, 1898, but was ceded to the United States after the Spanish-American War. The
                country was occupied by Japan during World War II and gained full sovereignty from the U.S. on July 4,
                1946. The Philippines has since developed into a democratic republic with a rich cultural heritage
                influenced by its indigenous, Asian, Spanish, and American past.

            <p>The carabao, also known as the water buffalo, is a significant animal in the Philippines, symbolizing the
                country's agricultural heritage. It has been a vital part of Filipino farming for centuries, used for
                plowing fields and transporting goods. The carabao is known for its strength, endurance, and ability to
                work in muddy rice paddies. It also holds cultural importance, often featured in festivals and
                traditional celebrations.</p>
